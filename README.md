# Building-Data-Engineering-Skills
My plan to upskill in the field of data engineering. 

Thanks for the clarification! Since you’ve been using Python and DBT for six months, we can focus on the next level of complexity for your learning plan. The goal for the first 3 months is to deepen your knowledge, handle more complex scenarios, and work on projects that can demonstrate your capabilities in a real-world setting.

Here’s a tailored plan that assumes you are already comfortable with the basics:

Month 1-3 Plan: Advanced Python, DBT, and Snowflake Projects

Week 1-2: Advanced Python for Data Engineering

1. Advanced Python Topics
Goal: Deepen your Python skills by learning advanced features that are commonly used in data engineering tasks.

Focus Areas:

Python Generators and Iterators: Learn how to use generators for memory-efficient data processing.
Concurrency/Parallelism: Study asynchronous programming (e.g., using asyncio), multithreading, and multiprocessing.
Python with APIs: Practice interacting with APIs to extract data (useful for real-time data pipelines).
Error Handling and Logging: Focus on better error handling practices, logging for debugging, and monitoring long-running ETL jobs.
Project:

API-based ETL Pipeline: Write a Python script that pulls data from a public API (e.g., weather data, financial data, etc.), transforms it, and stores it in a Snowflake database.
Example: Pull historical weather data from an API, clean the data, and load it into a Snowflake table for further analysis. Incorporate error handling, logging, and process concurrency if needed.

Week 3-4: Advanced DBT Techniques

2. Advanced DBT for Transformations
Goal: Build complex, production-ready transformations using DBT.

Focus Areas:

Incremental Models: Learn how to set up incremental models that update only new or changed records.
Snapshots: Dive deeper into snapshots for slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2) and implement them in your DBT models.
Advanced Macros: Use DBT macros for reusable logic and complex transformations.
Refactoring and Testing: Study how to refactor DBT models for efficiency and create custom tests for better data quality.
Project:

Building a Customer Orders Data Model: Create a DBT model to transform raw customer orders data into clean and optimized analytics tables, using incremental models, snapshots, and testing for data quality.
Example:
Create a snapshot for tracking customer status over time.
Build an incremental model to process daily orders only, ensuring you don’t reprocess the entire dataset.
Write custom tests for data integrity, such as checking for missing values or unexpected duplicates in critical fields.

Week 5-6: Snowflake Performance Optimization

3. Snowflake Query Optimization and Best Practices
Goal: Master performance optimization techniques in Snowflake to improve query performance and reduce costs.

Focus Areas:

Clustering and Partitioning: Learn how to effectively use clustering keys and partitioning to optimize Snowflake tables.
Query Profiling: Use Snowflake’s query profiling and execution plans to optimize SQL queries.
Materialized Views: Understand when and how to use materialized views for performance gains.
Data Sharing: Study how Snowflake enables data sharing between different business units or external partners.
Project:

Sales Analytics Optimized Pipeline: Create a Snowflake pipeline to process large sales data. Apply clustering keys on large tables (e.g., by region or product category) and optimize query performance for reporting purposes.
Example:
Load a large dataset of sales transactions.
Set up a Snowflake schema with appropriate clustering keys.
Analyze query performance before and after optimization (using query profiling).
Implement materialized views where applicable to speed up reporting queries.

Week 7-8: Airflow for Orchestration and Automation

4. Data Orchestration with Airflow
Goal: Learn how to use Airflow to orchestrate your ETL pipelines, schedule tasks, and monitor workflows.

Focus Areas:

Airflow Basics: Understand the architecture of Airflow, DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), operators, and scheduling.
Airflow with DBT: Learn how to trigger DBT runs from Airflow, ensuring smooth execution of your ETL pipelines.
Task Dependencies and Retry Logic: Master setting up complex task dependencies and retry mechanisms for fault tolerance.
Monitoring and Logging: Learn how to monitor Airflow jobs and manage errors with alerts.
Project:

End-to-End ETL Pipeline with Airflow: Set up an Airflow DAG that orchestrates your ETL pipeline (e.g., pulling data from an API, transforming it in DBT, and loading it into Snowflake).
Example:
Extract data from a web API, clean it with Python, and load it into Snowflake.
Use Airflow to schedule the ETL pipeline to run daily, and trigger the DBT models for transformation.
Implement retries and notifications for task failures.

Week 9-10: Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka or AWS Kinesis

5. Real-Time Data Processing
Goal: Learn how to build a real-time data pipeline using Kafka, AWS Kinesis, or another streaming platform.

Focus Areas:

Kafka Basics: Understand Kafka’s role in building distributed data streaming systems, including producers, consumers, and topics.
Setting up Kafka Streams: Learn how to set up Kafka producers and consumers in Python and process data in real time.
Integrating Kafka with Snowflake: Study how to ingest streaming data into Snowflake using Kafka and Snowflake’s native connectors or third-party tools.
Project:

Real-Time Sales Dashboard: Build a real-time sales pipeline that ingests live data from an e-commerce platform (e.g., through Kafka or AWS Kinesis), processes it in DBT, and loads it into Snowflake for near-instant analytics.
Example:
Set up a Kafka producer that simulates real-time sales data.
Use Kafka consumers to capture and process that data, applying transformations in DBT.
Create a dashboard (e.g., using Power BI or Tableau) that reflects real-time sales metrics.

Week 11-12: Final Project & Documentation

6. Final End-to-End Project
Goal: Complete a comprehensive project that combines Python, DBT, Snowflake, and Airflow, showcasing your ability to integrate different tools and platforms to build a production-ready data pipeline.

Project:

Sales Reporting Pipeline: Build a full-featured sales data pipeline that:

Extracts data from multiple sources (APIs, databases).
Transforms the data with DBT models.
Loads the data into Snowflake, optimizing for query performance.
Orchestrates the pipeline using Airflow.
Incorporates real-time data processing using Kafka or AWS Kinesis for live metrics.
Documentation:

Write clear, concise documentation for your project.
Include setup instructions, architecture diagrams, and explanation of code.
Example:

Create a pipeline that handles raw sales transactions, aggregates them by region and product, and loads them into Snowflake.
Use Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline, with daily runs and error-handling features.
Include a dashboard that reflects real-time sales and inventory data using Snowflake as the backend.

Learning Outcomes for Month 1-3:
Master advanced Python features and error handling for robust data processing.
Learn DBT’s advanced transformation techniques, including incremental models and snapshots.
Optimize Snowflake queries and setup for performance and cost efficiency.
Gain hands-on experience with orchestration using Airflow.
Understand how to build real-time data pipelines with Kafka or AWS Kinesis.
Complete a full, production-like project integrating these technologies.

Next Steps:
Once you finish the foundational aspects, you’ll be ready to dive deeper into cloud platforms, advanced cloud data engineering concepts, and CI/CD pipelines for data engineering workflows.
